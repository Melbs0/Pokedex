# My PokeDex

~~duuudeee this was tough~~

_made with blood, sweat, tears and love for OrangeTech+_

## this project implements the pokeAPI in a "totally" dinamic web app.

### somethings that did diferent from the tutor

- i intentionally didn't do some of the simplications that he did in his code

- tried to figure some of the problems by my self, so that's why the code may look junk in some parts

- didn't limit the number of pokemon you can request from the API, i'm really using this to show people that i can program a infinity list on HTML

## some ohter stuff i want to implement (~~emphazis on the want~~) to make this a bit better

- [ ] A page to show more details 'bout the pokemon you want

- [ ] A search engine to find anny pokemon you think (~~or any that's is present on the database kekw~~)
